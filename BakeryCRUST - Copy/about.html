    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <!-- Bakery history and mission statement -->
    <p>Golden Crust Bakery is a family-owned business founded in 2015 in Durban, South Africa.
      It began in a home kitchen, baking for friends and neighbors. As demand grew, a small shop was opened.
      Today, the bakery is known for its fresh breads, cakes, and pastries—blending traditional recipes with modern flavors.
      It remains a local favorite.</p>

    <p>Our mission is to bring delicious baked goods to everyone in our community.</p>
